/**
 * Manual Test Cases for Guild Builder Suggestions Dialog Feature
 * 
 * Since testing framework is not set up, here are manual test scenarios
 * to verify the suggestions dialog functionality works correctly:
 * 
 * Test Case 1: Wrong Selection Shows Single Suggestion Dialog
 * 1. Open Guild Builder challenge
 * 2. Select 3 companions with wrong roles (e.g., Developer, Project Manager, Tester)
 * 3. Click "Conferma Squadra"
 * 4. Verify a dialog appears with title "ðŸ’¡ Suggerimento"
 * 5. Verify only ONE suggestion is shown (for the first wrong role found)
 * 6. Verify specific suggestion text for Developer role
 * 7. Click "Ho capito!" to close the dialog
 * 
 * Test Case 2: Correct Selection No Dialog
 * 1. Open Guild Builder challenge
 * 2. Select correct companions (Social Media Wizard, Designer, Speaker)
 * 3. Click "Conferma Squadra"
 * 4. Verify no suggestion dialog appears
 * 5. Verify success message and challenge completion
 * 
 * Test Case 3: Dialog Closes on Selection Change
 * 1. Make a wrong selection and confirm to show suggestion dialog
 * 2. Change any companion selection while dialog is open
 * 3. Verify dialog closes immediately
 * 
 * Test Case 4: Dialog Closes on Restart
 * 1. Make a wrong selection and confirm to show suggestion dialog
 * 2. Click "Ricomincia" button while dialog is open
 * 3. Verify dialog closes and selections are reset
 * 
 * Test Case 5: Multiple Wrong Roles - Only First Shown
 * 1. Select 3 companions all with wrong roles (different from required)
 * 2. Click "Conferma Squadra"
 * 3. Verify dialog shows suggestion for only the first wrong role encountered
 * 4. Not all suggestions at once
 * 
 * Expected Suggestion Examples:
 * - Developer -> "Hai scelto un Developer in gamba, ma purtroppo non puÃ² esserti utile per questa missione. Sicuramente un Social Media Wizard sarebbe piÃ¹ adatto per gestire la visibilitÃ  sui social."
 * - Tester -> "Hai scelto un Tester di talento, ma per questa quest avresti bisogno di competenze diverse. Prova con un altro profilo!"
 * 
 * Dialog UX Requirements:
 * - Dialog should use NES.css styling
 * - Should have accessibility attributes (aria-labelledby, aria-describedby)
 * - Should close when clicking outside (via UiDialog behavior)
 * - Should close when pressing Escape (via UiDialog behavior)
 * - Should have a clear "Ho capito!" button to acknowledge the suggestion
